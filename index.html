    <h1>Tribute to my Dad</h1>
    <p>
        I am lost for words to describe this true legend. A man of character, charisma, and unquestionable integrity. From a young age you thought me real live values, morals and principles. Your love for family is unconditional and your dedication to duty unmatched; I still struggle to imbibe them all. Worst still, I am not privileged to shower you with same love, because just when I had the opportunity to, I lost you you the cold hands of death. If only I could... #teardrops
In my mind you are still here, because your memory lives on and thoughts of you evergreen. <br><br>
Adieu King!!!
